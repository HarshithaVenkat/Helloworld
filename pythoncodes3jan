When you've successfully started the installer, you should see the Git Setup wizard screen.
Follow the Next and Finish prompts to complete the installation. The default options are pretty
sensible for most users.
3. Open a Command Prompt (or Git Bash if during installation you elected not to use Git from the
Windows Command Prompt).
4. Verify the installation was successful by typing git --version:
$ git --version
5. Run the following commands to configure your Git username and email using the following
commands, replacing Emma's name with your own. These details will be associated with any
commits that you create:
$ git config --global user.name "sushmithakongi"
$ git config --global user.email "sushmitha.k@infobellit.com"
6. Later, initiate the git repository via remote repository.
